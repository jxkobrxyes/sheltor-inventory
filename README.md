# Cats"R"Us

## Overview

My first React project working with a team to create a fullstack webapp for a mock local cat adoption center. This project was a group effort that helped me and my team learn the importance of team collaboration building. 

My work was mostly revolved around the front-end components. Because Cats"R"Us is a single page website, I utilized React Router to handle navigations from a single page website using the navbar to switch paths as well as learn and use Scss: Sassy Cascading Style Sheets which is a relevent up-to-date way to write clean, quick and less css code.

I also contributed to assisting with running seeders with Node JS and sequelize to insert some default set of data to our sql database
