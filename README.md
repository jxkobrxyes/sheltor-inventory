# Cats"R"Us
## Overview
My first React project working with a team to create a website for a mock local cat adoption center. This project was a group effort that helped me and my team learn the importance of team collaboration building. 

My work was mostly revolved around the front-end components. Because Cats"R"Us is a single page website, I utilized React Router to handle navigations from a single page website using the navbar to switch paths.
